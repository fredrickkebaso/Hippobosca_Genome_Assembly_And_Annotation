#max_rd_len=149: specifies the maximum length of reads in the input files.
#[LIB]: indicates the start of a new library section, where the parameters for a specific library are specified.
#reverse_seq=0: specifies whether the reads need to be reverse-complemented before assembly. In this case, the value is set to 0, meaning no reverse-complementation is needed.
#asm_flags=3: specifies which parts of the assembly process to run. In this case, the value is set to 3, which means both contig and scaffold construction will be performed.
#rd_len_cutoff=20: specifies the minimum length of reads to be used in the assembly process. In this case, any reads with a length shorter than 20 base pairs will be excluded.
#rank=1: specifies the order in which reads are used for scaffolding. In this case, reads are sorted by their quality scores and used in descending order.
#pair_num_cutoff=3: specifies the minimum number of read pairs required to form a reliable connection between contigs during scaffolding.
#map_len=32: specifies the minimum length of overlap required between a read and a contig for the read to be considered a reliable match.
#q1 and q2: specify the input files containing the paired-end reads in FASTQ format.
