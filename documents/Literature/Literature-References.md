3.|18-10-2022|The Hippoboscidae (Insecta: Diptera) from Madagascar, with new records from the “Parc National de Midongy Befotaka”|Rahola et al., 2011|comprehensive review of Malagasy Hippoboscidae (sensu stricto i.e. excluding Nycteribiidae and Streblidae). Proposes the first illustrated dichotomous determination key for the genera and species currently known from Madagascar. Recent specimens of hippoboscids have been collected from Malagasy vertebrates and remain unstudied by fly specialists.|[PMC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3671411/)

5.|18-10-2022|Additions to the checklist of the louse flies (Diptera: Hippoboscidae) of Kenya|(Nelson, n.d.)|Summarry of various Hipposcus genus in Kenya and theier hosts and Diseases caused. Concludes that: The hippoboscid fauna of Kenya now comprises 22 species, less than half the number reported for the Afrotropical Region. This family is epidemio- logically significant, because blood-sucking adults are known to act as vectors of many infectious agents. They definitely deserve more attention than they recently have had.|[Research-gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/JozefObona/publication/308509007_Additions_to_the_Checklist_of_the_Louse_Flies_Diptera_Hippoboscidae_of_Kenya/links/5d11e184a6fdcc2462a35f13/Additions-to-the-Checklist-of-the-Louse-Flies-Diptera-Hippoboscidae-of-Kenya.pdf)
