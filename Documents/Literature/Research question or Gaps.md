## Research question

A reference genome provides wealth molecular basis of insights into an organism. The completion of the major genome projects such as the Human Genome Project (HGP) spurred a myriad of scientific publications on human health. The Hippoboscus(lousefly), an hematophagous ectoparasite of birds and mammals, have no an assembled  reference genome of any of its species, deposited or made available as of 28th October 2022 in the genome assembly database (NCBI and GenBank). 
The closest genome assembly available is at the genus level for the  *Melophugus ovinus* (Sheep ked) in the Hippoboscidae family . This accounts for the little scientific knowledge available up to date about the Hippposcus biology. Additionally, the lack of a reference genome limits the molecular basis of the little findings.This is postulated to complicate research around this fascinating keds. Due to this the following gaps exist and further research has been  recommended: 



- There are no reports on molecular investigation on the role of Hippoboscus species (*H.longipennis,H.camelina and H.variegata*) as vectors of infectious pathogens in birds and mammals.

- An attempt to resolve species of keds through  DNA  barcoding  of  COI  gene  has been   unsuccessful   possibly   because   these   flies   are   little studied and have poor representation in the databases [Kidambasi et al., 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32510036/).


- Little is known regarding their taxonomy, parasitism, avian host associations, or geographical distribution [Goater et al., 2018](https://bioone.org/journals/journal-of-parasitology/volume-104/issue-2/17-171/Hyperparasitism-of-an-Avian-Ectoparasitic-Hippoboscid-Fly-Ornithomya-anchineuria-by/10.1645/17-171.short). This is based on morphological traits which may not be as accurate as the molecular classification.

- Hippobosca longipennis has been reported to light on humans and occasionally bite but the extent of their ability to feed on humans is unknown [Rani et al., 2011](https://parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-3305-4-143).

- Transmission dynamics of pathogens between the host and the vector, whether there it happens during blood feeding or during host shifts [n.d](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/vbz.2011.0649)has remained unknown.


The availability of the reference genome or assembly is therefore key to resolve some of these key questions and will spur research among the scientific community on the keds. The noble task lies at the bottom of this study. Here we aim to:

1. Perform a de novo assembly of the genome at the species level using genomic data obtained from 3 species that include:
- H.variegata
- H.longipennis
- H.camelina
2. Completely annnotate the assembled genome and 
3. Perform phylogenetic analysis.
