## Research questions

There is no a genome assembly or reference genome of any of the hippoboscus species deposited or made available as of 28th October 2022 in the genome assembly database (NCBI). 
The closest genome assembly available is at the genus level for the  *Melophugus ovinus* (Sheep ked) in the Hippoboscidae family . There is therefore a no reference for the researchers to infer their findings from. 
This is postulated to complicate research around this fascinating keds. Due to this the following gaps exist and further research is recommended: 

- No reports on molecular investigation on the role of Hippoboscus species (H.longipennis,H.camelina and H.variegata) as vectors of transmission of infectious pathogens.

- Little is known regarding their taxonomy, parasites, avian host associations, or geographical distribution [Goater et al., 2018](https://bioone.org/journals/journal-of-parasitology/volume-104/issue-2/17-171/Hyperparasitism-of-an-Avian-Ectoparasitic-Hippoboscid-Fly-Ornithomya-anchineuria-by/10.1645/17-171.short). This is based on morphological traits which may not be as accurate as the molecular classification.

- Transmission dynamics of pathogens between the host and the vector, whether there it happens during blood feeding or during host shifts [n.d](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/vbz.2011.0649).

- Hippobosca longipennis has been reported to light on humans and occasionally bite but the extent of their ability to feed on humans is unknown [Rani et al., 2011](https://parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-3305-4-143).

- An attempt to resolve species of keds through  DNA  barcoding  of  COI  gene  has been   unsuccessful   possibly   because   these   flies   are   little studied and have poor representation in the databases [Kidambasi et al., 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32510036/).
