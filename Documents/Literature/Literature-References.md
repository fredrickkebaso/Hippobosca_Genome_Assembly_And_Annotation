15-10-2022 |Salivarian Trypanosomosis: A Review of Parasites Involved, Their Global Distribution and Their Interaction With the Innate and Adaptive Mammalian Host Immune System |(Radwanska et al., 2018) |Reviews the classification and global distribution of the trypanosome parasites, highlights the adaptation of human infective trypanosomes that allow them to survive innate defence molecules unique to man, gorilla, and baboon serum and refers to the discovery of sexual reproduction of trypanosomes in the tsetse vector. With respect to the immunology of mammalian host-parasite interactions, the review highlights recent findings with respect to the B cell destruction capacity of trypanosomes and the role of T cells in the governance of infection control. Understanding infection-associated dysfunction and regulation of both these immune compartments is crucial to explain the continued failures of anti-trypanosome vaccine developments as well as the lack of any field-applicable vaccine-based anti-trypanosomosis intervention strategy. Also details the lifecycle of the tsetse and trypanosome.Finally, the link between infection-associated inflammation and trypanosomosis-induced anemia is covered in the context of both livestock and human infections|[Pub-med](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6175991/)
17-10-2022 |Genome Sequence of the Tsetse Fly (Glossina morsitans): Vector of African Trypanosomiasis |(Attardo et al., 2014) |Describes the sequence and annotation of the 366-megabase Glossina morsitans morsitans genome. Analysis of the genome and the 12,308 predicted protein-encoding genes that led to multiple discoveries, including chromosomal integrations of bacterial (Wolbachia) genome sequences, a family of lactation-specific proteins, reduced complement of host pathogen recognition proteins, and reduced olfaction/chemosensory associated genes. These genome data provide a foundation for research into trypanosomiasis prevention and yield important insights with broad implications for multiple aspects of tsetse biology. The paper highlights: 1. Characteristics of the Glossina Genome 2.Genomic aspects of Glossina in-relation to: - Blood feeding and nutrition -Immunity - Reproduction and Developmental Biology - Sensory Genes as Targets for Glossina Control Strategies| [Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24763584/)
