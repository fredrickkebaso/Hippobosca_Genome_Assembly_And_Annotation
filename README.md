# Hippoboscus De novo Genome Assembly


## Background of the study

Hipposboscids (Diptera: Hippoboscidae)  are hematophagous or blood-sucking, obligate ectoparasites that infest birds, mammals and rarely humans.
They are postulated as vectors responsible for the transmission of infectious pathogens such as Rickettsiae (e.g. Coxiella and Anaplasma ), acanthocheilonema dracunculoides and T.vivax   during the blood-feeding process. The bites inflict pain when feeding to the host and lead to blood loss and anaemia with a heavy infestation and finally death of the organism if not checked.

For decades these flies have remained neglected and disregarded by the scientific community and veterinarians, despite their devastating health effects. The little-known facts are based on morphological traits and parasitological methods and very little molecular work has been done on these parasites.
The preliminary research related to the genetics of these little-known hippoboscids demonstrates the necessity to develop full-scale genomic resources to address the vector competence of these ectoparasites, their genetic makeup and epidemiology.

This study focuses on the de novo genome assembly of three Hippoboscus species; 
- *H.variegata, 
- H.longipennis and 
- H.camelina*. 
The availing of the genome assembly will spur molecular-based insights and other researches that will provide answers to many scientific questions that have remained pending for a decade.
