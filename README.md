## Role of sylvatic transmission in the AAT of livestock in Shimba Hills.

### Background of the study.

Animal African trypanosomiasis (AAT) is a fatal livestock disease across Africa, caused by trypanosomes (***Trypanosoma***) and transmitted by tsetse flies (***Glossina***). Even though wild animals are generally resistant to clinical trypanosomiasis, asymptomatic trypanosome infections are frequent in wildlife and have long been thought to represent a substantial potential reservoir for AAT in livestock. Such sylvatic transmission is crucial in AAT epidemiology, but this has neverbeen confirmed. 
This project aims to investigate the role of sylvatic transmission in the AAT of livestock by quantifying wildlife-to-livestock transmission in Shimba Hills National Reserve using the flies collected within and outside the park as a proxy. Whole-genome sequence data from 34 Trypanosoma congolense isolated from host blood (livestock) and 81 from tsetse flies are available for this study.

### Main objective

- Determine the role of wildlife in *T.congolense* sylvatic transimission of African Animal Trypanosomiasis to livestock.

### Specific objectives

- Develop a bioinformatics workflow to to identify the fly hosts, filter out host and vector reads, call the variants.
- Determine transimmission dynamics of AAT from wildlife to livestock.
- Determine Genetic diversity of T.congolense in Shimba Hills.


#### Questions to be answered: 

1. Are trypanosomes transmitted between wildlife and livestock?  if so, how often, relative to domestic transmission?

2. Are there genetic differences between trypanosome strains in wild and domestic animals?
