# Hippoboscus De novo Genome Assembly


## Background of the study

Hipposboscids (Diptera: Hippoboscidae) are hematophagous or blood-sucking, obligate ectoparasites that infest birds, mammals and rarely humans. They are postulated as vectors responsible for the transmission of infectious pathogens such as Rickettsiae (e.g. Coxiella and Anaplasma ), *acanthocheilonema dracunculoides* and *T.vivax* during the blood-feeding process. The bites inflict pain on the host when feeding causing skin irritation and blood loss. It may lead to anaemia with a heavy infestation and finally death of the organism if not checked. 
Genetic and Molecular work is scanty around this organism. For decades these flies have remained neglected and disregarded by the scientific community and veterinarians, despite their devastating health effects. The little-known facts are based on morphological traits and parasitological methods and very little molecular (Genetic) work has been done around these parasites. The preliminary research related to the genetics of these little-known hippoboscids demonstrates the necessity to develop full-scale genomic resources to address the vector competence of these ectoparasites, their genetic makeup and epidemiology.
This study focuses on the de novo genome assembly of three Hippoboscus species;

- *H.variegata*
- *H.longipennis*
- *H. camelina*

The availing of the genome assembly will provide the knowledge base upon which vector competence, epidemiology and effective control strategies of the hippoboscus flies will be based. Furthermore, it will spur molecular-based insights into the genetics of these organisms and other research that will provide answers to many scientific questions that have remained pending for decades.


## Statement of Objectives

A reference genome provides comprehensive, unbiased genomic information about an organism at the molecular level. In addition, it provides new insights not documented in the existing references about the assembled DNA sequences. Constructing the genomic assembly of; H.variegata, H.longipennis and H.camelina inform this study.

To this purpose, this study aims to: 
1. Perform a de novo assembly of the genome of the 3 species
2. Completely annotate the assembled genome
3. Perform phylogenetic analysis.
