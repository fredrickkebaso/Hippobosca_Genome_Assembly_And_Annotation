# De-novo-Genome-Assembly-and-chemosensory-gene-annotation-in-_Hippobosca-variegata_-and-_Hippobosca camelina_


## Background of the study

***Hippoboscids*** (keds/flies) are obligate hematophagous or blood-sucking ectoparasites that infest birds, mammals, and rarely humans. They vector pathogens such as *Anaplasma camelii* and *Acanthocheilonema dracunculoides*. The keds require about 1.5mg of blood in a span of 6 hours at an interval of 13 minutes as such heavy infestation would lead to anemia when unchecked. The frequent and rapid feeding intervals result in numerous painful bites on the host, prompting the host to scratch against rough surfaces. The scratches lead to the development of wounds, creating a conducive environment for myiasis, a condition where larvae infest the host's wounds.  The occurrence of myiasis adds to the economic burden for farmers, as it results in increased production costs and substantial losses when livestock succumb to the negative effects of this infestation.

The control strategies of vector-borne diseases (VBDs) and their effects target the vector itself, thereby controlling the transmission rates of the vectored pathogens. Most vectors, particularly Dipterans or Insects, have developed a robust chemosensory system that plays a vital role in their ability to locate hosts for feeding, mates for reproduction, and predator evasion, which ultimately contributes to their successful establishment ecologically. To effectively suppress pathogen transmission to hosts, strategies have been devised to exploit the vector's chemosensory system in order to trap and repel the vectors themselves.

In this study, we hypothesize that Hippoboscus, a dipteran, relies extensively on its chemosensory system to locate its host, facilitate reproduction, and potentially transmit pathogens.
A genome assembly for the *Hippobosca* species is currently unavailable in the genome database. This limits access to molecular insights on Hippobosca species, particularly the chemosensory system.

This study therefore focused on generating a whole genome assembly for two *Hippobosca* species: *Hippobosca variegata* and *Hippobosca camelina* and describing their chemosensory system.

The availing of the genome assembly will provide the knowledge base upon which vector competence, epidemiology and effective control strategies of the hippoboscus flies will be based.

**Figure 4: shows the phylogenetic clustering of all the predicted putative chemosensory genes for _Hippoboscus_ species and selected models from the closest species.**
Each chemosensory gene family is colored distinctly as defined by the key on the right of the figure. The tree leaves indicate the aligned genes with the prefix GMOY, representing selected models from _Glossina morsitans_ yale isolate, GBRI- _Glossina Brevipalpis_, and FBp - _Drosophila melanogaster_. The _Hippoboscus_ individual gene names (temporal working gene names) are prefixed as _H. variegata_ (hv) and _H. camelina_ as hc for all aligned gene sequences.
